### Patch Changes

  Thanks [@tamimbinhakim](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim)! - Hash-bucketed
  catalog layout — flat per locale, deduped by construction

  Replaces the source-tree-mirroring chunk layout with a flat hash-bucketed
  shape.

  **Before** (chunked by source path — deeply nested, awkward to grep / diff):

  ```
  .translations/
    en/
      apps/web/src/components/Button.json
      apps/web/src/components/Header.json
      packages/ui/src/Card.json
      ...
  ```

  **After** (16 buckets per locale, name = first hex digit of the key's hash):

  ```
  .translations/
    en/
      0.json   1.json   ...   f.json
    es/
      0.json   1.json   ...   f.json
    .meta.json
  ```

  ### What changes for users
  - **Catalog keys are 12-char SHA-256 hashes** (`041c03cfcadc`) instead of
    literal source strings. Plain-string `useT('Sign out')` calls hash
    internally; users still write the literal source. `<T>` blocks already used
    `t.<hash>` keys — those persist with the same shape.
  - **Same hash → same bucket across every locale.** `en/3.json`, `es/3.json`,
    `fr/3.json` carry the same key set, just with different translated values.
  - **Cross-locale alignment is structural.** No drift between locales when keys
    move; the hash is content-addressed.
  - **Smaller, finer-grained diffs.** Adding or changing one string touches one
    bucket file per locale.
  - **Bundler tree-shaking improves.** Each bucket is an independent JSON
    import; SPAs ship only buckets a route actually touches.

  ### Auto-migration on read

  Runtime loaders (`fsCatalogLoader`, Vite virtual module) and the CLI catalog
  reader transparently rekey old literal-keyed catalogs into the new hashed
  layout on first read. Existing apps Just Work after upgrade — the next
  `extract` / `translate` run reshapes the on-disk files.

  ### New CLI command

  ```bash
  npx autotranslate migrate-format
  ```

  Forces every locale through the writer. Useful when you want to migrate
  without running `translate` (e.g., in a one-shot CI codemod). Drops the legacy
  provider cache as part of the run.

  ### New public API
  - `sourceKey(literal, context?)` — produce the catalog storage key for a given
    source string. Stable, deterministic.
  - `buildCatalog(entries)` — convenience for hand-rolled catalogs (tests,
    programmatic overrides). Hashes literal keys, passes `t.*` tree keys
    through.

  ### `chunkBits` config

  ```ts
  defineConfig({
    // ...
    catalog: {
      chunkBits: 4, // default — 16 buckets. Range 0..12.
    },
  });
  ```

  | `chunkBits` | Buckets              | When to pick                                    |
  | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
  | `0`         | 1 (single flat file) | tiny apps (<100 strings), simplest mental model |
  | `4`         | 16                   | **default** — 100 to ~10k strings               |
  | `8`         | 256                  | very large catalogs                             |
  | `12`        | 4096                 | enterprise scale, massive lazy-load surface     |

  ### Performance trade-off

  Translator hot path adds one SHA-256 of the literal key per `t()` call:
  roughly 1.1µs/call (was 0.4µs). Still ~50× under the published <50µs/call
  target. Catalog gzipped size is unchanged at the bench.

  Thanks [@tamimbinhakim](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim)! - Fix subpath type
  resolution under legacy `moduleResolution`

  Reported:
  `Cannot find module '@autotranslate/core/config' or its corresponding type declarations.ts(2307)`
  when consuming the package from a TypeScript project with
  `moduleResolution: 'node10'` (the older default).

  **Root cause.** Subpath exports (`@autotranslate/core/config`,
  `@autotranslate/react/server`, etc.) declared their types via the `exports`
  field only. Modern resolvers (`bundler` / `node16` / `nodenext`) read this
  field; legacy `node10` does not, so the types were unresolvable on older
  tsconfigs.

  **Fixes applied to every public package:**
  1. **Nest `types` per condition.** Each subpath now provides explicit
     `import.types` (→ `.d.ts`) and `require.types` (→ `.d.cts`) so consumers
     resolve the correct declaration shape for their module system.
  2. **Add `typesVersions`** mapping each subpath to its `.d.ts` for legacy
     `node10` resolvers. This is the documented compat path.

  After this release, all subpath imports resolve cleanly under `node10`,
  `node16`, `nodenext`, and `bundler` resolution. Verified with
  `@arethetypeswrong/cli`.

  No runtime change. Patch-level bump.

  Thanks [@tamimbinhakim](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim)! - `autotranslate`
  1.0.0-beta — public API freeze candidate

  The surface is stable enough to call. This release is published under the
  `beta` npm dist-tag (`pnpm add @autotranslate/core@beta`) and exists to soak
  the API in real apps before the GA cut.

  What landed since 0.2:
  - Chunked translation catalogs and per-chunk caching
  - Per-chunk AI context-prefix for consistency across long documents
  - Glossary support + first-class hybrid provider
  - Streaming dev-mode translation (Vite + Next)
  - Performance benchmarks published in `docs/performance.md`
  - Public-API contract enumerated in `STABILITY.md`
  - TypeScript Language Service plugin (`@autotranslate/typescript-plugin`)
  - Copy-experiments package (`@autotranslate/experiments`)
  - Migration guides for `react-i18next`, `next-intl`, `lingui`, `gt-next`

  What's expected to change before 1.0 GA:
  - Real-world soak (a few weeks of production use across multiple frameworks)
  - A handful of additional formatter slots — `<List>` (`Intl.ListFormat`) and
    `<Unit>` (`Intl.NumberFormat({ style: 'unit' })`) at minimum
  - Final pass on cookbook recipes informed by user feedback

  The on-disk catalog format, runtime hashing scheme, public exports, and CLI
  contracts are all considered frozen modulo bug fixes. See `STABILITY.md`.

### Minor Changes

  [`feb528c`](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim/autotranslate/commit/feb528c5bb859edb1819c7714762f6cc24edc714)
  Thanks [@tamimbinhakim](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim)! - New package:
  `@autotranslate/experiments`

  Copy experiments for autotranslate. Variants live in your catalog and get
  translated like any other string; the package picks which one to render.

  ```tsx
  import {
    ExperimentProvider,
    Experiment,
    Variant,
  } from '@autotranslate/experiments';

  <ExperimentProvider assignments={{ 'cta-text': 'urgent' }}>
    <Experiment name="cta-text">
      <Variant id="control">
        <T context="cta">Sign up</T>
      </Variant>
      <Variant id="urgent">
        <T context="cta">Start now — limited time</T>
      </Variant>
    </Experiment>
  </ExperimentProvider>;
  ```

  Or hook-style with `useExperiment('cta-text')`.

  The package doesn't ship a flag system — resolve assignments upstream with
  whatever you use (Vercel `flags`, GrowthBook, LaunchDarkly, your own header)
  and pass the resolved map to `<ExperimentProvider>`. The README documents the
  Vercel `flags` integration as a one-paragraph adapter pattern.

  Variants flow through extraction → AI translation → typegen exactly like any
  other string. Use `context` to disambiguate the source string between
  variants.
